# Git commit behavior

When the user says **commit** or **push** (e.g. "commit", "push", "commit everything", "commit and push"):

1. **Stage the entire repo:** run `git add .` (do not selectively add files).
2. **Commit:** use a clear message (either from the user or a short summary of recent work).
3. **Push:** run `git push` to the current branch.

Do not use `git add <file1> <file2>` for commit requests—always use `git add .` unless the user explicitly asks to commit only specific files.
